      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        WHO I AM

        Hello there! I'm Princess. ðŸ˜Š Here, I'll provide you with a brief insight into who I am. For a more detailed exploration, please check out my LinkedIn profile. At 18 years old, I hail from Edo state, Nigeria, currently residing in Lagos. Pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in software development at BYU-Idaho online, my fascination with computers and technology stems from childhood, influenced by my Mom's friend whom I greatly admired.
        
        Computers have been a constant in my life, and since my early years, I've harbored a deep passion for cooking, with Pounded Yam and Egusi ranking as my absolute favorite dish. While my culinary interests persist, these days I find joy in baking. Additionally, I'm on a journey to become an adept photographer, steadily improving my skills despite some initial less-than-perfect shots.
        
        EDUCATION
        
        Education serves as the cornerstone of my life, guiding me toward a future shaped by knowledge and growth. My enthusiasm for learning is unwavering, and I strive to apply the insights gained in my daily life. I've successfully completed my Pathway Connect certificate with top grades and am currently on the path to earning my Bachelor's degree in software development.
        
        Beyond formal education, I actively participate in short-term courses offered by platforms like LinkedIn Learning and Coursera. If you wish to delve into my certificates and educational journey, feel free to explore my LinkedIn profile for a more comprehensive view.
        
        WORK EXPERIENCE
        
        In my professional journey, I've honed a robust work ethic through roles in sales. Despite the divergence from programming in these past positions, I've consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence. My past experiences have ingrained in me the importance of effective communication, adaptability, and a results-oriented mindset â€“ qualities that transcend industry boundaries.
        
        While my work history may not be directly in programming, my quality education in software development positions me as an ideal candidate for any programming role. The skills and principles cultivated in diverse work environments uniquely equip me to contribute effectively to programming teams.
        
        WHAT KIND OF JOB I'M LOOKING FOR
        
        Thank you for expressing interest in getting to know me better. I am actively seeking to join a programming team where my versatility and commitment can thrive. With a solid foundation in programming and databases, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully as a developer. Despite acknowledging the continuous journey of growth, my age and educational background instill confidence in my potential to make valuable contributions.
        
        If you find that I align with your requirements, please feel free to reach out. I am eager and ready to collaborate!
